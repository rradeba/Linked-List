BE Module 12 Lesson 3: Assignment | Linked List
Remember to take your time and work through each question diligently! Test your code, make sure it works, and try to find ways to improve. Once you are happy and satisfied with your code, upload it to Github, then turn in your Github link at the bottom of the page!

Don't forget. Make sure this assignment is in it's own repository. Not mixed in with others!

Implementing a Singly Linked List in Python
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to reinforce understanding of the singly linked list data structure and its implementation in Python.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with implementing a singly linked list class in Python. The class should support basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Task 1

Implement the Node class to represent individual nodes in the linked list.
Task 2

Implement the SinglyLinkedList class with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Task 3

Test the implemented functionality by performing various operations on the linked list.
Expected Outcomes:

Students should be able to implement a singly linked list in Python.
Students should understand the basic operations of insertion, deletion, and traversal in a linked list.
Students should be able to test the implemented functionality and verify its correctness.
Implementing a Doubly Linked List in Python
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to introduce students to the doubly linked list data structure and its implementation in Python.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with implementing a doubly linked list class in Python. The class should support operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Task 1

Implement the **Node** class to represent individual nodes in the doubly linked list.
Task 2

Implement the **DoublyLinkedList** class with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Task 3

Test the implemented functionality by performing various operations on the doubly linked list.
ðŸ’¡ We can also implement Doubly Linked Lists. You can read the following resource to learn more about it.

Resource: Medium Doubly Linked List

Expected Outcomes:

Students should be able to implement a doubly linked list in Python.
Students should understand the differences between singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
Students should be able to test the implemented functionality and verify its correctness.

NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
